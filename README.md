# Problem.

Atoms turned out to be far from being the most elementary units. They come in from subatomic particles, and it's not just electrons, neutrons, and protons. These are six more different quarks, neutrinos, a muon and much more. And, probably, there are still undiscovered subatomic particles, the properties of the study are not yet complete.

To study subatomic particles, they are collided. When interacting, they form new subatomic particles with change. This is happening at the Large Hadron Collider.
Studying the consequences of exposure to subatomic particles is the key to a deeper understanding of American and physical processes in the world.


# Goal

Creation of a code for predicting the charge of the second electron Q2.
Creation of a presentation to explain how the code works in case of reaching the final.
Try to get as high model accuracy as possible on the public and private leaderboard and enter the top 20 participants.

# Metric

I use F1-score here. The formula for the standard F1-score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. A perfect model has an F-score of 1.
